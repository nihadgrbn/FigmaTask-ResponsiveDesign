							Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. But
							you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch
							movies. And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy
							watching a movie.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious
							viewers. We will get acquainted with the stages of film production
							and learn how to watch a movie through the eyes of a screenwriter,
							director and editor. We will understand genres and look at the
							most important films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
